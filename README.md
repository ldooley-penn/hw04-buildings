# CIS 5660 HW04 Procedural Buildings

## Project Planning

For this project I want to recreate the style of the Sugarbush Resort in Warren VT.

These reference images are courtesy of the sugarbush website:

I envision the procedural process of building this being:

1.  Define a base layout using lines , whether fully procedural or art directable.
2. Segment the layout into 2 types, either the more barn like type you can see on the right of the first image, or the more standard sloped building you see on the left of the first image.
3. Give the layout thickness depending on the segmented type.
4. Build up floors, with the bottom one being stone and wood otherwise.
5. Add first floor overhang with support columns.
6. Adding balconies with support beams.
7. Use booleans or other methods for creating roofs.

### Assets
I will need assets for brick walls, windows, fences, columns, wood panneling for walls, roof shingles, and sliding doors.
